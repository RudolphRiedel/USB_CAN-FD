# USB_CAN-FD

This is an Open Source Hardware USB to CAN-FD Interface.

It is based on the ATSAME51 microcontroller from Microchip and features two isolated CAN-FD channels.

This is WIP, the first three Revisions are up and running.
I just ordered some more rev 3 boards, this time party populated, to increase the amount of testers.

There is an idea for a rev 4 board with a different controller but unfortunately these are not
available anywhere so this got pushed back.

The software for this project is here: https://github.com/jgressmann/supercan
